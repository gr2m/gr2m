## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm the maintainer of [the JavaScript Octokit](https://github.com/octokit/octokit.js/) â€“ GitHub's official JavaScript SDK.

If you have any questions about GitHub's APIs or automation, and you think it would be interesting for others, too, please create an issue in my [helpdesk](https://github.com/gr2m/helpdesk) repository. Questions by people new to coding are strongly encouraged! I do semi-regular live shows about exploring and hopefully answering your questions on my twitch channel: [twitch.tv/gregorcodes](https://www.twitch.tv/gregorcodes)

You can also ask and follow me on Twitter: [twitter.com/gr2m](https://twitter.com/gr2m)
